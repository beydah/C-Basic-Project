# 10 C Language Projects (For Beginners)


This project includes the code for fundamental algorithmic problems that I created when starting out in software development and the C language. The codes consist of 10 different problems arranged from easy to difficult, which helps improve software skills from basic to complex. The codes in the project not only assist in enhancing basic C programming skills but also foster algorithmic thinking. This way, programming skills and problem-solving abilities are developed step by step, enabling a more competent entry into the world of software.

The fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project provide an opportunity to improve software skills by solving them step by step. By examining these codes, you can learn the basic structures of the C language and algorithm design. Additionally, by developing problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking, you can enhance your intellectual capacity.

In conclusion, the code for fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project is ideal for improving programming skills and algorithmic thinking when entering the world of software. By solving problems step by step, it enhances mastery of the basic C language and enables approaching more complex software projects with increased confidence.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my fundamental skills in the C programming language. I encountered various challenges, but I learned to solve them using debugging techniques and step-by-step approaches. I also discovered the importance of organizing code in a modular way and communicating between functions. Throughout this project, I improved myself by facing these challenges, practicing and using external resources.

I strengthened my fundamental skills in the C programming language and enhanced my problem-solving abilities in this project. I adopted a patient and systematic approach to overcome challenges encountered during the debugging process. Additionally, I applied modular programming principles to make the code more sustainable and readable. By practicing documentation and commenting in this project, I increased the comprehensibility of the code and facilitated collaboration. These experiences significantly improved my programming skills and intellectual capacity.

In summary, by developing my fundamental skills in the C programming language through this project, I made a stronger start in the world of software. I made efforts to overcome challenges encountered and adopted a solution-oriented approach step by step. Through the codes and algorithms provided in this project, I increased my intellectual capacity and advanced my problem-solving skills. The experiences gained from this project helped me approach more complex projects in the future with increased confidence.

## Features

- "Hello World": This program simply prints the phrase "Hello World" to the console, serving as a basic introduction to programming.

- "Program to print the number entered by the user": This program prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the entered number to the console.

- "Check if the entered number is positive or negative": This program prompts the user to enter a number and then determines whether the entered number is positive or negative.

- "Check if the entered number is odd or even": This program prompts the user to enter a number and then checks whether the entered number is odd or even.

- "Program to add two numbers": This program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates their sum.

- "Program to find the average of two numbers": This program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates their average.

- "Program to find the largest among three numbers": This program prompts the user to enter three numbers and then determines the largest number among them.

- "Program to find the sum of N natural numbers": This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer N and then calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers.

- "Program to generate the Fibonacci series within a specified range": This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer N and then generates the Fibonacci series up to the Nth term.

- "Program to find prime numbers within a specified range": This program prompts the user to enter two positive integers representing the lower and upper bounds of a range. It then finds and prints all the prime numbers within that range.
