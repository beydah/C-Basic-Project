# C Basic Project: Repository of Fundamental Starting Codes in C

C-Basic-Project represents a repository that contains my own codes of fundamental starting codes in the C programming language. In this repository, you can find basic codes to get started with C programming.


## Lessons Learned

Development of Programming Skills: In this project, I enhanced my fundamental skills in the C programming language. I started to have a better understanding of C's structures, data types, and operations.

Debugging Abilities: During the coding process, I faced various challenges and encountered errors. However, I tackled these issues by utilizing debugging techniques and taking step-by-step approaches. I learned to identify the root causes of errors, inspect the code, and take necessary steps to resolve them.

Modular Programming: Through this project, I learned how to organize code in a modular manner and establish communication between functions. This not only improved the sustainability of the code but also enhanced its reusability and readability.

Importance of Documentation and Comments: While developing the project, I realized the significance of creating clear and understandable documentation and comments within the code. Ensuring code comprehensibility is crucial not only for my future references but also for facilitating collaboration with others.

Problem-Solving Skills: The challenges encountered during the project have honed my problem-solving abilities. I developed skills such as creative thinking, conducting research, and effectively utilizing available resources.

To overcome these challenges, I dedicated myself to ample practice and actively confronted problems. Additionally, conducting research, seeking support from communities, and having others review my code have been instrumental in my progress.

## Features

- Hello World: A classic introductory project, "Hello World" allows you to write your first program in C, which simply prints a basic "Hello World" message to the screen.

- Increment and Decrement: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and performs increment and decrement operations on that number, displaying the results on the screen.

- Triangle Area Calculation: Write a program that takes the base length and height of a triangle from the user and calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: Area = (Base * Height) / 2.

- Factorial Calculation: Prompt the user to enter a number and write a program that calculates the factorial of the given number. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should output 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

- Palindrome Check: Ask the user to enter a word or sentence and write a program that checks whether the input text is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.

- Number Guessing Game: Create a game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it. The program should provide hints by indicating whether the guess is correct, higher, or lower.

- Prime Numbers: Write a program that checks if a user-entered number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

- File Operations: Create a text file and ask the user to input some text. Write a program that writes the input text to the file and then reads the file to display its contents on the screen.

- Simple Calculator: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). Write a program that performs the specified operation and displays the result on the screen.

- Bubble Sort Algorithm: Write a program that uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of elements. Prompt the user to enter the elements of the array and display the sorted array on the screen.
